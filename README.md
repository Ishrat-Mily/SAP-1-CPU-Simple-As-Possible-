# SAP-1-CPU-Simple-As-Possible-
# SAP-1 Microprocessor Design using Logisim Evolution

**Course Project ‚Äì VLSI Design Laboratory**

---

## üìò Abstract
This project presents the **design and implementation of a Simple As Possible (SAP-1) microprocessor** using *Logisim Evolution*.  
The SAP-1 architecture demonstrates fundamental concepts of digital design, including **data buses, control sequencing, instruction decoding, and arithmetic logic operations**.  
To complement the hardware design, a custom **Assembler Application (React-based)** is developed to automatically convert assembly mnemonics into Logisim-compatible hexadecimal machine code.

## üß† Project Objectives
- To design each functional block of the SAP-1 microprocessor:
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
  - **Control Unit (Sequencer)**
  - **Registers (A, B, Instruction Register, Program Counter, Output Register)**
  - **Memory Unit (16√ó8 RAM/ROM)**
  - **System Bus**
- To integrate all modules into a complete working microprocessor.
- To test sample assembly programs through both **Logisim simulation** and the **Assembler web app**.
